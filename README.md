# Lab 1: Image as a 2D Signal

This MATLAB lab explores how images behave as 2D signals using concepts from signal processing such as sampling, quantization, and contrast adjustment.

## Sections
1. **Quantization:** Comparing 8-bit, 6-bit, and 4-bit versions shows banding and reduced dynamic range.
2. **Histogram & Contrast Stretching:** Adjusting intensity improves visibility of mid-range details.
3. **Gamma Correction:** Nonlinear remapping; gamma < 1 brightens, gamma > 1 darkens.
4. **Sampling & Aliasing:** Downsampling reduces resolution; upsampling causes visible blocky artifacts (aliasing).
